 ## Triangular-State-Machines-TSM  
 
This repository is a place for development of triangular state machines (TSMs) introduced in the paper "[Understanding Developmental Incongruity Through Dynamical Heterochrony](https://github.com/Orthogonal-Research-Lab/Developmental-Incongruities-and-Heterochrony/blob/master/Developmental-Incongruity-Heterochrony.md)"  

### Contents:

1) _slidesx_.png: slides showing the order of activation and other features of a TSM model (part of a reticulating binary tree).  

2) _acting-in-cis_.md: contains rules for _cis_-action in a TSM model.  

3) _x_.png files demonstrating heterochronic trajectories and overlapping trees.  

4) _transitivity.md: contains information and examples about transitive action in a TSM model.
